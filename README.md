##  Inference

1. **Download Pretrained Weights**
   Download both versions (with and without fine-tuning) from the [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13FleJ8FCO_gZtZ-qPzGlqJHhB-HlO_u9?usp=drive_link), and place them in the `weights/` directory.

2. **Prepare Your Data**
   Ensure your NCCT scan is in `.nii.gz` format.

3. **Run Inference**
   Modify paths in `inference.py` as needed:

   ```bash
   python inference.py
   ```

##  Synthetic Dataset Generation

Our synthetic dataset pipeline consists of three main steps:

1. **Download [ImageCAS](https://github.com/XiaoweiXu/ImageCAS-A-Large-Scale-Dataset-and-Benchmark-for-Coronary-Artery-Segmentation-based-on-CT) (CCTA) Dataset**
   This acts as anatomical templates.

2. **Extract Anatomical Structures**
   Use [TotalSegmentator](https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator) on ImageCAS to segment structures (e.g., myocardium, aorta, heart).

3. **Generate Synthetic NCCT Volumes**
   Run the MATLAB script:

   ```matlab
   data_engine.m
   ```

   Each execution produces one synthetic volume per template. You can run multiple times to expand the dataset.

## Training

1. **Preprocess Data**
   We follow the nnU-Net data preprocess pipeline and format, but use **custom normalization**, as seen in `inference.py (line 105)`.

2. **Set Configurations**
   Open `config.json` and set:

   * Training data path
   * Output directory
   * Training hyperparameter etc.

3. **Run Training**

   ```bash
   python training.py
   ```

##  Implementation Highlights
* **Synthetic Data Engine**

   See `data_engine.m` for details on synthesizing NCCT volumes from anatomical templates.

* **Anatomy-informed Contrastive Learning**

  See `contrastive_loss_branchAware` in `inference.py` for how voxel-level pseudo-negatives are generated using anatomical priors.
